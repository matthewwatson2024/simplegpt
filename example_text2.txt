Steve Jobs
Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5,
2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and
investor best known for co-founding the technology
company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT
and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He
was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of
the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted
shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972
before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled
through India, seeking enlightenment before later
studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded
Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's
Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained
fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of
the Apple II, one of the first highly successful massproduced microcomputers.
Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in
1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
interface (GUI). This led to the development of the
largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the
breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first massproduced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh
launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for
example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the
Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature
vector graphics and PostScript.
In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power
struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO,
John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple
employees with him to found NeXT, a computer
platform development company that specialized in
computers for higher-education and business markets,
serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer
graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off
independently as Pixar.

computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and
became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of
commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.
In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the
company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely
responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge
of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer
Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that
had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the
"Think different" advertising campaign, and leading to
the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes
Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a
board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.[4]
In
2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor. He died of tumor-related respiratory arrest in 2011; in 2022, he was
posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Since his death, he has won 141 patents;
Jobs holds over 450 patents in total.[5]
Steven Paul Jobs[6][note 1] was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne
Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: الجندلي الفتاح عبد(. Abdulfattah Jandali was
born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining
his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political
science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of SwissGerman descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love
but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith. When Schieble became
pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.[7]
Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected,
but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul
Reinhold Jobs and his wife Clara. Paul Jobs, an American of German descent, was the son of a dairy
farmer from Washington County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high school, Paul Jobs worked as a
mechanic, then joined the US Coast Guard. After he was discharged at San Francisco, Paul married
Clara Hagopian of Armenian descent in February 1946 and they moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana,
where Paul worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman. Since Clara missed San Francisco, she
convinced Paul to move back. There, Paul worked as a repossession agent, and Clara became a
bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple looked to adopt a child.
[7] Since
they lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers, and went to
court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family,
but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son's college tuition.[7][8]

I always thought of myself as a humanities
person as a kid, but I liked electronics... then I
read something that one of my heroes, Edwin
Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of
people who could stand at the intersection of
humanities and sciences, and I decided that's
what I wanted to do.
—Steve Jobs
[12]
The childhood family home of Steve Jobs
on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is
the original site of Apple Computer. The
home was added to a list of historic Los
Altos sites in 2013.
[18]
In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church.[9] When Steve was in high school, Clara
admitted to Steve's girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the
first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we
won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I
wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already
aware,[10] and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Jobs would
"bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his "adoptive parents", and he regarded them as his
parents "1,000%". Jobs referred to his biological parents as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not
harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."[11]
Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a
try as a machinist,[13] several other jobs,[14] and
then "back to work as a machinist". Paul and
Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957,[15]
and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta
Loma neighborhood in Mountain View,
California.
[16] Paul built a workbench in his
garage for his son in order to "pass along his love
of mechanics". Jobs, meanwhile, admired his
father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to
build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would
build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into
fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[17]
Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom,
tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and
was suspended a few times. He frequently played pranks on
others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View.
His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never
reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for
not challenging his brilliant son.[19] Jobs skipped the 5th
grade and transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle
School in Mountain View, where he became a "socially
awkward loner".[20] Jobs was often "bullied" at Crittenden
Middle, and in the middle of 7th grade, he gave his parents an
ultimatum: either they would take him out of Crittenden or he
would drop out of school.[21]
The Jobs family was not affluent, and only by expending all
their savings were they able to buy a new home in 1967, allowing Steve to change schools. The new
house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino
School District, in Cupertino, California.
[22] The house was declared a historic site in 2013, as the first

Jobs's Homestead High School

site of Apple Computer.[18] As of 2013, it was owned by Jobs's sister, Patty, and occupied by his
stepmother, Marilyn.[23] When he was 13, in 1968,[24] Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of
Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project.[25]
The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to
attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to
Silicon Valley.
[12] He began his first year there in late 1968 along with
Bill Fernandez,
[26] who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would
become Apple's first employee. Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose
father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus
decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class.[26] Jobs had
grown his hair long and become involved in the growing
counterculture, and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with
McCollum and lost interest in the class.[26]
Jobs underwent a change during mid-1970. He later noted to his
official biographer that "I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I
started to read more outside of just science and technology —
Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this
phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked
like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." During his last two years at
Homestead High, Jobs developed two different interests: electronics and literature.[27] These dual
interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year, as his best friends were Wozniak and
his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.
[28]
In 1971, after Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a
few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University's student union.
Instead of joining the electronics club, Jobs put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avantgarde jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as "kind of brain and kind of hippie
... but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was
too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider.
In high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you weren't in a carefully
defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was
suspect." By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking a freshman English class at Stanford and
working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan.[29][30]
Around that time, Wozniak designed a low-cost digital "blue box" to generate the necessary tones to
manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. He was inspired by an article
titled "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire.
[31] Jobs decided then to
sell them and split the profit with Wozniak. The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well
and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable.[32]
In a
1994 interview, he recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to design the blue boxes.[33]
Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an
Apple".[34]
 He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.[35][36]

I was interested in Eastern mysticism which
hit the shores about then. At Reed there was a
constant flow of people stopping by – from
Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, to Gary
Snyder. There was a constant flow of
intellectual questioning about the truth of life.
That was the time when every college student
in the country read Be Here Now and Diet for
a Small Planet.
—Steve Jobs
[43]
I was lucky to get into computers when it was
a very young and idealistic industry. There
weren't many degrees offered in computer
science, so people in computers were brilliant
people from mathematics, physics, music,
zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one
was really in it for the money [...] There are
people around here who start companies just
to make money, but the great companies, well,
that's not what they're about.
—Steve Jobs
[47]
By his senior year of high school, Jobs began using LSD.
[27] He later recalled that on one occasion he
consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale, and experienced "the most wonderful feeling of my
life up to that point".[37]
In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and
Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al.[38]
In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.
[39] He insisted on applying
only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.[40] Jobs soon
befriended Robert Friedland,
[41] who was Reed's student body president at that time.[42] Brennan
remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed.
After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of
Reed College without telling his parents.[44] Jobs
later explained this was because he did not want
to spend his parents' money on an education that
seemed meaningless to him. He continued to
attend by auditing his classes,[45]
including a
course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert
Palladino. In a 2005 commencement speech at
Stanford University, Jobs stated that during this
period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm
rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money,
and got weekly free meals at the local Hare
Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said:
"If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had
multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts".[46]
In February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents'
home in Los Altos and began looking for a
job.[48] He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los
Gatos, California, as a computer
technician.
[48][49] Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak
designed his own version of the classic video
game Pong and gave its electronics board to
Jobs. According to Wozniak, Atari only hired
Jobs because he took the board down to the
company, and they thought that he had built it
himself.[50] Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell

later described him as "difficult but valuable", pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in
the room, and he would let people know that".[51]
Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974[52]
to visit Neem Karoli Baba[53] at his Kainchi ashram with his
Reed College friend and eventual Apple employee Daniel Kottke, searching for spiritual teachings.
When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died
in September 1973. Then, they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan
Babaji.
[49]
After seven months, Jobs left India[54] and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke.[49] Jobs had
changed his appearance; his head was shaved, and he wore traditional Indian clothing.
[55][56] During
this time, Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling his LSD experiences "one of the two or
three most important things [he had] done in [his] life".[57][58] He spent a period at the All One Farm,
a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert Friedland.
During this time period, Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the
Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen
Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US.[59] He considered taking up monastic
residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen,[60] Japanese cuisine,
and artists such as Hasui Kawase.
[61]
Jobs returned to Atari in early 1975, and that summer, Bushnell assigned him to create a circuit board
for the arcade video game Breakout in as few chips as possible, knowing that Jobs would recruit
Wozniak for help. During his day job at HP, Wozniak drew sketches of the circuit design; at night, he
joined Jobs at Atari and continued to refine the design, which Jobs implemented on a breadboard.
[62]
According to Bushnell, Atari offered $100 (equivalent to about $600 in 2024) for each TTL chip that
was eliminated in the machine. Jobs made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if
Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, within four
days Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 45, far below the usual 100, though Atari later re-engineered
it to make it easier to test and add a few missing features.[63] According to Wozniak, Jobs told him
that Atari paid them only $750 (instead of the actual $5,000), and that Wozniak's share was thus
$375.[64] Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later but said that if Jobs had
told him about it and explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[65]
Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping
stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.[66] According to a document
released by the United States Department of Defense, Jobs claimed that in 1975, he was arrested in
Eugene, Oregon, after being questioned for being a minor in possession of alcohol. Jobs alleged that
he "didn't have any alcohol", but police questioned him, and subsequently determined that he had an
outstanding arrest warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket. Jobs claimed he then paid the $50 fine. The
arrest allegedly occurred "behind a store".[67][68]
By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs,
who suggested that they sell it; Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed.[70]
In April
of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple
Apple (1976–1985)

Basically Steve Wozniak and I invented the
Apple because we wanted a personal
computer. Not only couldn't we afford the
computers that were on the market, those
computers were impractical for us to use. We
needed a Volkswagen. The Volkswagen isn't as
fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling,
but the VW owners can go where they want,
when they want and with whom they want.
The VW owners have personal control of their
car.

For what characterizes Apple is that its
scientific staff always acted and performed like
artists – in a field filled with dry personalities
Computer Company (now called "Apple Inc.") as
a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist
Drive home on April 1, 1976. The operation
originally started in Jobs's bedroom and later
moved to the garage.[71][72] Wayne stayed briefly,
leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary
cofounders of the company.[73]
The two decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs
returned from the All One Farm commune in
Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the
farm's apple orchard.
[74] Jobs originally planned
to produce bare printed circuit boards of the
Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for
$50 (equivalent to about $280 in 2024) each. To
fund the first batch, Wozniak sold his HP
scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.
[75][76] Later that year, computer retailer Paul
Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.[77][78] Eventually, about 200 Apple
I computers were produced in total.[79]
A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who
would greet his clients "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and
hippie-like". Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just
earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled
dismissing Jobs's budding business compared to the established
industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punch
cards: "Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with
a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a
keyboard. He said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to
be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea." Jobs's friend from Reed
College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that as an early Apple employee, he "was the only person
who worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn't
get his hands dirty in that sense." Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs's
kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.[23]
They received funding from semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike
Markkula.
[80] Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a
"glass age ceiling" in Silicon Valley because he'd created a very successful company at a young age.[36]
Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock, who, after looking at the crowded Apple
booth at the Home Brew Computer Show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the Apple
board.[81] Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor in
February 1977 to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple.[82][83]
After Brennan returned from her own journey to
India, she and Jobs fell in love again, as Brennan
noted changes in him that she attributes to

limited by the rational and binary worlds they
inhabit, Apple's engineering teams had
passion. They always believed that what they
were doing was important and, most of all,
fun. Working at Apple was never just a job; it
was also a crusade, a mission, to bring better
computer power to people. At its roots, that
attitude came from Steve Jobs. It was "Power
to the People", the slogan of the sixties,
rewritten in technology for the eighties and
called Macintosh.

[84]
Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was
also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype
Apple II computer to Brennan and his parents in
their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this
time period, where the two main influences on
Jobs were Apple Inc. and Kobun.
In April 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the
Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire.
[85]
It
is the first consumer product to have been sold
by Apple Computer. Primarily designed by
Wozniak, Jobs oversaw the development of its
unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique
power supply.[86] During the design stage, Jobs
argued that the Apple II should have two
expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, Wozniak threatened that Jobs
should "go get himself another computer". They later agreed on eight slots.[87] The Apple II became
one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products in the world.[88]
As Jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship with Brennan grew more
complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel
Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.
[89] Brennan eventually took a
position in the shipping department at Apple.[90] Brennan's relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his
position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship. In October 1977,
Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take "a paid apprenticeship designing
blueprints for the Apples".[91] Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her,
given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her
ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized
she was pregnant, and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face,
according to Brennan, "turned ugly" at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the
beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I
just didn't want to do that."[92]
 He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.[92]
Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. A few weeks before she was due to
give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm. She accepted the offer.[91]
When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)[92] Brennan gave birth
to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.[91] Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by
Robert Friedland, their mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a
name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the
name "Lisa" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name "Lisa" while he
"was also publicly denying paternity". She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was
preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was
"Claire" after St. Clare). She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a
computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase,

[93] Decades
later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that "obviously, it was named for my
daughter".[94]
When Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established him as Lisa's father.[95]
It required him to pay
Brennan $385 (equivalent to about $1,200 in 2024) monthly in addition to returning the welfare
money she had received. Jobs paid her $500 (equivalent to about $1,600 in 2024) monthly at the time
when Apple went public and made him a millionaire. Later, Brennan agreed to an interview with
Michael Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special, released on January 3,
1983, in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the
Year, the magazine named the generic personal computer the "Machine of the Year".[96]
In the issue,
Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which stated that the "probability of paternity for
Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%".[95] He responded by arguing that "28% of the male population of the United
States could be the father". Time also noted that "the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has
placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa".[95]
In 1978, at age 23, Jobs was worth over $1 million (equivalent to $4.82 million in 2024). By age 25,
his net worth grew to an estimated $250 million (equivalent to $865 million in 2024). He was also
one of the youngest "people ever to make the Forbes list of the nation's richest people—and one of only
a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth".[97]
In 1982, Jobs bought an
apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive
reputation. Although he never lived there,[98] he spent years renovating it thanks to I. M. Pei. In 1983,
Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend
the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?".[99]
In 1984, Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate and resided there for a decade. Thereafter, he
leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing weathering
to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house to
build a smaller, contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the house was finally demolished
in 2011, a few months before he died.[100]
Jobs took over development of the Macintosh in 1981,
from early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who had
conceived the project. Wozniak and Raskin had heavily
influenced the early program, and Wozniak was on leave
during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that
year, making it easier for Jobs to take over the
project.[101][102][103] On January 22, 1984, Apple aired a
Super Bowl television commercial titled "1984", which
ended with the words: "On January 24th, Apple
Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why
1984 won't be like 1984."[104] On January 24, 1984, an
emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly
enthusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders
meeting held in the Flint Auditorium at De Anza
College.[105][106] Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as "pandemonium".[107] The

Macintosh was inspired by the Lisa (in turn inspired by Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user
interface),[108][109] and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales.[110][111]
However, its low performance and limited range of available software led to a rapid sales decline in
the second half of 1984.[110][111][112]
Sculley's and Jobs's respective visions for the company greatly differed. Sculley favored open
architecture computers like the Apple II, targeting education, small business, and home markets less
vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a
business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the
board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies,
duplicating services.[113] Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the
company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. Many
left, including Wozniak, who stated that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the
last five years" and sold most of his stock.[114] Though frustrated with the company's and Jobs's
dismissal of the Apple II in favor of the Macintosh, Wozniak left amicably and remained an honorary
employee of Apple, maintaining a lifelong friendship with Jobs.[115][116][117]
By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became
clear,[110][111] and it strengthened Sculley's position in the company. In
May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize
Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from
the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product
Development". This move would effectively render Jobs powerless
within Apple.[118]
In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of
Sculley and take over Apple. However, Jobs was confronted after the
plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board
declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. Sculley also told
Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the
reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs
submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional
senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new
venture, NeXT.[119]
The Macintosh's struggle continued after Jobs left Apple. Though
marketed and received in fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was hard to sell.[120]:308–309
In 1985, Bill
Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it
was granted "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical
user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over the
similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface."[120]:321 Sculley granted Microsoft the
license which later led to problems for Apple.[120]:321
In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran
Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh
preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so "through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface
was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple".[120]:322
Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's
TopView or Digital Research's GEM,[120]:322 and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to
9/9/25, 11:24 PM Steve Jobs - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs 10/51
be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the
1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone
market".[120]:322
Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc.
[121] with $7 million. A year
later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon.
Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the
company.[122] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback
event,[123] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event[124]
that was described as a multimedia
extravaganza.[125] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco,
California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988. Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs
was at NeXT he was "really getting his head together".[101]
NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at $9,999 (equivalent to about $24,000 in
2024). Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the
education sector but was largely dismissed as cost prohibitive.[126] The NeXT workstation was known
for its technical strengths, chief among them its object-oriented software development system. Jobs
marketed NeXT products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its
innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip,
and the built-in Ethernet port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim
Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1990 at CERN in Switzerland.[127]
The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first
"interpersonal" computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative NeXTMail
multimedia email system, NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the
first time. "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and
groupwork", Jobs told reporters.[128] Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as
evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube's magnesium case.[129] This put
considerable strain on NeXT's hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000
machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel.
[130]
The company reported its first yearly profit of $1.03 million in 1994.[131]
In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc.
released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by
Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store,[130] MobileMe services,
and the iTunes Store.[132]
In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's
computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company
as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.[133]

Jobs and his Pixar team visited the Oval
Office in 1998.
The first film produced by Pixar with its Disney partnership,
Toy Story (1995), with Jobs credited as executive
producer,[134] brought financial success and critical acclaim to
the studio when it was released. Over the course of Jobs's life,
under Pixar's creative chief John Lasseter, the company
produced box-office hits A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2
(1999), Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), The
Incredibles (2004), Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), WALL-E
(2008), Up (2009), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Cars 2 (2011).
Brave (2012), Pixar's first film to be produced since Jobs's
death, honored him with a tribute for his contributions to the
studio.[135] Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille,
WALL-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Brave each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature,
an award introduced in 2001.[136][137]
In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar's contract with Disney was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive
Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,[138] and in January 2004, Jobs
announced that he would never deal with Disney again.[139]
In October 2005, Bob Iger replaced Eisner at Disney, and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with
Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase
Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4  billion. When the deal closed, Jobs became The Walt
Disney Company's largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company's
stock.[140] Jobs's holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of Disney
family member Roy E. Disney, who until his 2009 death held about 1% of the company's stock and
whose criticisms of Eisner—especially that he soured Disney's relationship with Pixar—accelerated
Eisner's ousting. Upon completion of the merger, Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the
board of directors as the largest individual shareholder.[140][141][142] Upon Jobs's death his shares in
Disney were transferred to the Steven P. Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs.
[143]
After Jobs's death, Iger recalled in 2019 that many warned him about Jobs, "that he would bully me
and everyone else". Iger wrote, "Who wouldn't want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company
is run?", and that as an active Disney board member "he rarely created trouble for me. Not never but
rarely." He speculated that they would have seriously considered merging Disney and Apple had Jobs
lived.[139] Floyd Norman, of Pixar, described Jobs as a "mature, mellow individual" who never
interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers.[144]
In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and
Walt Disney Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to "just
explain it to them until they understand" in disagreements. Catmull released the book Creativity, Inc.
in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs. Regarding his own manner
of dealing with Jobs, Catmull writes:[145]
In all the 26 years with Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments, and
it's not my nature to do that. ... but we did disagree fairly frequently about things. ... I would
say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster
than I could. ... I would then wait a week ... I'd call him up, and I give my counterargument to
what he had said, and he'd immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week, and

Conference & Expo in 2005.
occasionally this went on for months. But ultimately one of three things happened. About a
third of the time he said, "Oh, I get it, you're right", and that was the end of it. And it was
another third of the time in which [I'd] say, "Actually I think he is right". The other third of
the time, where we didn't reach consensus, he just let me do it my way, never said anything
more about it.[145]
In 1996, Jobs's former company Apple was struggling and its survival
depended on completing its next operating system. After failed
negotiations to purchase Be Inc.,
[146][147] Apple eventually came to a
deal with NeXT in December[148]
for $400 million; the deal was
finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had
cofounded.[149] Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio
was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief
executive on September 16.[150]
In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's
efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated several projects,
such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months,
many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in
the elevator, "afraid that they might not have a job when the doors
opened. The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but
a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company."[151]
Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it
too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.
With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found
its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved
into Mac OS X. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the
introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful
branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the
"interim" modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[152] Jobs quipped at the time
that he would be using the title "iCEO".[153]
The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances.
With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes
Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007,
Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display
cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile browser,
revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing open-ended innovation, Jobs also
reminded his employees that "real artists ship".[154]
1997–2011
Return to Apple
9/9/25, 11:24 PM Steve Jobs - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs 13/51
Jobs and Bill Gates were a panel at the
fifth D: All Things Digital conference in
2007.
Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Jobs
first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige boxes".[155] On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner
Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer
company, he said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders".[156] Then, in 2006,
Jobs emailed all employees when Apple's market capitalization rose above Dell's. It read:
Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's
stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may
be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve.[157]
Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which
has been dubbed the "reality distortion field" and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches
(colloquially known as "Stevenotes") at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers
Conferences.
[158]
Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake, Levi's
501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.[159][160] Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson "...he
came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the
rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style".[159]
In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of
7.5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. It
was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the
exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged
that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of
$20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple
overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs
potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil
penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil
government investigations,[161]
though an independent
internal Apple investigation completed on December 29,
2006, found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that
the options granted to him were returned without being
exercised in 2003.[162]
In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by
lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A
few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The Computer
TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University
graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read "Steve, don't be a miniplayer—recycle all e-waste".[163]
In 2006, he further expanded Apple's recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac.
This program includes shipping and "environmentally friendly disposal" of their old systems.[164] The
success of Apple's unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns,
propelling Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.[165]

Jobs speaking at the Apple Worldwide
Developers Conference in 2007
Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist[166][167] who
always aspired to position his businesses and their products at
the forefront of the information technology industry by
foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. He
summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech
at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by
quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky:
There's an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. "I
skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it
has been". And we've always tried to do that at Apple.
Since the very, very beginning. And we always
will.[168]
On July 1, 2008, a $7 billion class action suit was filed against
several members of the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities
fraud.[169][170]
In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met
with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and
told Obama that he was "headed for a one-term presidency".[171] Jobs proposed that any foreign
student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green
card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, "The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us
reasons why things can't get done ... It infuriates me".[171]
In October 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with cancer. In mid 2004, he announced to his employees that
he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas.
[172] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor;[173]
however, Jobs stated that he had a rare, less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine
tumor.
[172]
Jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[174]
in favor of
alternative medicine. Other doctors agree that Jobs's diet was insufficient to address his disease.
However, cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski wrote that "it's impossible to
know whether and by how much he might have decreased his chances of surviving his cancer through
his flirtation with woo. My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of
survival, if that."[175][176] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's
integrative medicine department,[177] on the other hand, said, "Jobs's faith in alternative medicine
likely cost him his life ... He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable ... He
essentially committed suicide."[178]
According to biographer Walter Isaacson, "for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his
pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined".[179] "Instead, he tried a vegan
diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a
psychic. He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings

and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004."[180][181] He underwent a
pancreaticoduodenectomy (or "Whipple procedure") that appeared to remove the tumor
successfully.[182][183] Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
[172][184] During Jobs's
absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.[172]
In January 2006, only Jobs's wife, his doctors, and Iger knew that his cancer had returned. Jobs told
Iger privately that he hoped to live to see his own son Reed's high school graduation in 2010.[139]
In
early August 2006, Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference.
His "thin, almost gaunt" appearance and unusually "listless" delivery,[185][186]
together with his choice
to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters, inspired a flurry of media and
internet speculation about the state of his health.[187]
In contrast, according to an Ars Technica
journal report, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw Jobs in person said he
"looked fine".[188] Following the keynote, an Apple spokesperson said that "Steve's health is
robust".[189]
Two years later, similar concerns followed Jobs's 2008 WWDC keynote address.[190] Apple officials
stated that Jobs was victim to a "common bug" and was taking antibiotics,[191] while others surmised
his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure.[184] During a July conference call
discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs's health by
insisting that it was a "private matter". Others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given
Jobs's hands-on approach to running his company.[192][193] Based on an off-the-record phone
conversation with Jobs, The New York Times reported, "While his health problems amounted to a
good deal more than 'a common bug', they weren't life-threatening and he doesn't have a recurrence of
cancer".[194]
On August 28, 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of Jobs in its corporate
news service, containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death. News carriers customarily
stockpile up-to-date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well-known figure's death.
Although the error was promptly rectified, many news carriers and blogs reported on it,[195]
intensifying rumors concerning Jobs's health.[196] Jobs responded at Apple's September 2008 Let's
Rock keynote by paraphrasing Mark Twain: "The reports of my death are greatly
exaggerated."[197][198] At a subsequent media event, Jobs concluded his presentation with a slide
reading "110/70", referring to his blood pressure, stating he would not address further questions
about his health.[199]
On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that marketing vice-president Phil Schiller would deliver
the company's final keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo 2009, again reviving
questions about Jobs's health.[200][201]
In a statement given on January 5, 2009, on Apple.com, Jobs
said that he had been suffering from a "hormone imbalance" for several months.[202][203]
On January 14, 2009, Jobs wrote in an internal Apple memo that in the previous week he had
"learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought".[204] He
announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on
his health. Tim Cook, who previously acted as CEO in Jobs's 2004 absence, became acting CEO of
Apple, with Jobs still involved with "major strategic decisions".[204]

Flags flew at half-staff outside
the Apple Infinite Loop campus
on the evening of Jobs's death.
In 2009, Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type, and the
donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation. Jobs yelled, "I'll never let you do that. I'll
never do that."[205]
In April 2009, Jobs underwent a liver transplantation at Methodist University
Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee.
[206][207][208] Jobs's prognosis was described as
"excellent".[206]
On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple
announced that he had been granted another leave of absence. Jobs announced his leave in a letter to
employees, stating his decision was made "so he could focus on his health". As it did at the time of his
2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs
would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.[209][210] While on leave,
Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June
6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7.[211]
On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the board, "I have
always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as
Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come."[212] Jobs became
chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO.[213][214] Jobs continued to work
for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.[215][216][217]
Jobs died at his home in Palo Alto, California on October 5, 2011, due
to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,
[66][218][219] which resulted in
respiratory arrest.
[220] He had lost consciousness the day before and
died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.[221] His sister,
Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours
earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking,
he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then
at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them.
Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.' " He then lost
consciousness and died several hours later.[221] A small private funeral
was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for
Jobs's family, were not made public.[222]
Both Apple[223] and Pixar issued announcements of his death.[224]
Apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public
service, but were encouraging "well-wishers" to send their
remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages.[225] Apple and
Microsoft both flew their flags at half-staff throughout their respective headquarters and
campuses.[226][227]

Bob Iger ordered all Disney properties, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland, to fly their flags
at half-staff from October 6 to 12, 2011.[228] For two weeks following his death, Apple displayed on its
corporate website a simple page that showed Jobs's name and lifespan next to his portrait in
grayscale.[229][230][231] On October 19, 2011, Apple employees held a private memorial service for Jobs
on the Apple campus in Cupertino. It was attended by Jobs's widow, Laurene, and by Tim Cook, Bill
Campbell, Norah Jones, Al Gore, and Coldplay. Some of Apple's retail stores closed briefly so
employees could attend the memorial. A video of the service was uploaded to Apple's website.[232]
California Governor Jerry Brown declared Sunday, October 16, 2011, to be "Steve Jobs Day".[233] On
that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at Stanford University. Those in attendance included
Apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, politicians, and family
and close friends of Jobs. Bono, Yo-Yo Ma, and Joan Baez performed at the service, which lasted
longer than an hour. There was high security with guards at all of the university's gates, and a
helicopter overhead from an area news station.[234][235] Each attendee was given a small brown box as
a "farewell gift" from Jobs, containing a copy of the Autobiography of a Yogi (1946) by Paramahansa
Yogananda.
[236]
Childhood friend and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,
[237]
former owner of what would
become Pixar, George Lucas,
[238] his competitor Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates,
[239] and President
Barack Obama[240] all made statements in response to his death. At his request, Jobs was buried in an
unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in Palo Alto.[241][242]
Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced
Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[243] and his sense of intuition was influenced
by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[243] Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs
from Richard Sapper.
[244] According to Apple co-founder Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't
an engineer and he didn't do any original design...".[245][246] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest
employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the
inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person."[247]
He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent
applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user
interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves,
lanyards, and packages. His contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the
product". He and his industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.[248] Most
of these are design patents as opposed to utility patents or inventions; they are specific product
designs such as both original and lamp-style iMacs, and PowerBook G4 Titanium.
[249][250] He holds
43 issued US patents on inventions.[249] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with
"magnification" feature was issued the day before he died.[251] Although Jobs had little involvement in
the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[246] Jobs later used his CEO
position to directly involve himself with product design.[252]
Innovations and designs
9/9/25, 11:24 PM Steve Jobs - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs 18/51
The Apple II, here with an external
modem, was designed primarily by Steve
Wozniak.
Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time marketing executive and confidant
Joanna Hoffman, known as one of the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand
up to Jobs while also engaging with him.[253] Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched
new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.[221] He despised the oxygen monitor on his
finger, and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.[254]
The Apple I was designed entirely by Wozniak, but Jobs had the idea of selling the computer, which
led to the founding of Apple Computer in 1976. Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I
prototype by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings. Eventually, 200 units were
produced.[79] One of the main innovations of the Apple I was that it included video display terminal
circuitry on its circuit board, allowing it to connect to a low-cost composite video monitor or
television, instead of an expensive computer terminal, compared to most existing computers at the
time.
The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's
first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer
products,[88] designed primarily by Wozniak. Jobs oversaw
the development of the Apple II's unusual case[255] and Rod
Holt developed the unique power supply.[86]
It was
introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs
and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple. The
Apple II was first sold on June 10, 1977.[256][257]
The Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from
1978 and sold in the early 1980s to business users. It is the
first personal computer with a graphical user interface.
[258] The Lisa sold poorly at 100,000 units,[259]
but despite being considered a commercial failure, it received technical acclaim, introducing several
advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles. In 1982,
after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,[260] he took over the Macintosh project, adding
inspiration from Lisa. The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.
[261]
Once he joined the Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a
traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company.[101] Jobs launched the Macintosh on
January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user
interface and mouse.
[262] This first model was later renamed to Macintosh 128k among the prolific
series. Since 1998, Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product
family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since inception. The Macintosh was introduced by a
US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984".[263]

Jobs holds up a MacBook Air
at the MacWorld Conference &
Expo, 2008.
The original iMac was
introduced in 1998 as the first
consumer-facing Apple product
to have debuted after Jobs's
return.
Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, received as a "watershed
event"[264] and a "masterpiece".[265] Regis McKenna called the ad
"more successful than the Mac itself".[266]
It uses an unnamed heroine
to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style
picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from
the conformity of IBM's domination of the computer industry. The ad
alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which
describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big
Brother".[267][268]
The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to
be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64
for consumers, and the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying
clone market for businesses.[269] Macintosh systems still found success
in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the secondlargest PC manufacturer for the next decade.
After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started NeXT, a workstation computer company. The
NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Using the NeXT Computer, Tim
Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the WorldWideWeb. The NeXT Computer's
operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of Apple's
operating systems such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS.
[270][271]
Apple's iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design is
directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of
our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's".[272]
Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic,
was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple
introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the
shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one
design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the
user such as the handle and a "breathing" light effect when the
computer went to sleep.[273] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that
time. The iMac's forward-thinking changes include eschewing the
floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting
peripherals. Through the iMac's success, USB was popularized among
third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many
early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic to match the
iMac design.[274]

iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management
application developed by Apple. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video on
personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store
is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.[275]
Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows,
audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the
iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and
iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.
[275]
The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its
small size achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that
time. The capacity of the first-generation iPod ranged from 5  GB to 10  GB.[276] The iPod sold for
US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod
resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.[277] Also, the iPod's success
prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.[278] After the first few generations of
iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the
screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.[277]
Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The
iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its
release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets
list in 2010, in the category of Communication.[279] The completed iPhone had multimedia
capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was
released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA.
In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a
faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller.[280] The iPhone 4 was thinner than previous models,
had a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary frontfacing camera for video calls.[281] A major feature of the iPhone 4s, introduced in October 2011, was
Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.[282]
The iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple. The first iPad was
released on April 3, 2010. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including
a virtual keyboard. The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models. As of
April 2015, more than 250 million iPads have been sold.[283]

Jobs introduced the iPad in 2010.
Jobs's house in Palo Alto
In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when
he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business,
where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that
Laurene "was right there in the front row in the lecture hall,
and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of
thought, and started feeling a little giddy".[284] After the
lecture, he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to
dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a
few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life.[285]
Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990; they married on
March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee
Hotel in Yosemite National Park.
[286] Fifty people, including
Jobs's father, Paul, and his sister Mona, attended. The
ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino
Otogawa.
[286] The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of
Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike and
Laurene's brothers' snowball fight. Jobs reportedly said to Mona: "You see, Mona [...], Laurene is
descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir".[287]
Jobs's and Powell's first child, a son named Reed, was born in 1991.[288] Jobs's father, Paul, died a
year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Jobs's childhood home remains a tourist attraction and is
currently owned by his stepmother (Paul's second wife), Marilyn Jobs.[289] Jobs and Powell had two
more children, daughters Erin (b. 1995) and Eve Jobs (b. 1998), who is a fashion model.[288] The
family lived in Palo Alto, California.
[290] Although a billionaire, Jobs made it known that, like Gates,
he had stipulated that most of his monetary fortune would not be left to his children.[291][292]
Chrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, "he apologized many times over for
his behavior" towards her and Lisa. She said Jobs "said that he never took responsibility when he
should have, and that he was sorry".[293] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with
Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from "Lisa Brennan"
to "Lisa Brennan-Jobs".[10] Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a
change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson,
who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs.[10] Jobs had found Mona after first
finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.[294]
Personal life
Marriage
Family
9/9/25, 11:24 PM Steve Jobs - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs 22/51
I grew up as an only child, with a single
mother. Because we were poor and because I
knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I
imagined he looked like Omar Sharif. I hoped
he would be rich and kind and would come
into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished
apartment) and help us. Later, after I'd met
my father, I tried to believe he'd changed his
number and left no forwarding address
because he was an idealistic revolutionary,
plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even
as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting
for a man to love, who could love me. For
Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however. He later
told his official biographer Walter Isaacson: "I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't
consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never
wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found
out".[294] However, in 1986, when Jobs was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to
spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption,
information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the
name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the
doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he
died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that "his mother had been an unmarried
graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble".[294]
Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early 1986 and after he received permission from his
father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.[294]
Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need "to see if
she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three
and she went through a lot to have me."[295] Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though
she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been
pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly
apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble developed a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his
life and spent Christmas together.[296]
During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a
brother.[295] Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first
impression of Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet
guy".[297] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.
[297] Jobs later told
his biographer that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her
mother so emotionally affectionate toward me ... As we got to know each other, we became really good
friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My
adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."[297]
Jobs then learned his family history. Six months
after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's
father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a
daughter, Mona.[298][299] Jandali states that after
finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work,
and then Schieble left him.[298] They divorced in
1962[12] and he said then he lost contact with
Mona for a time:
I also bear the responsibility for being
away from my daughter when she was
four years old, as her mother divorced
me when I went to Syria, but we got
back in touch after 10 years. We lost
touch again when her mother moved

decades, I'd thought that man would be my
father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he
was my brother.
—Mona Simpson
[221]
and I didn't know where she was, but
since 10 years ago we've been in
constant contact, and I see her three
times a year. I organized a trip for her
last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and
she went with a relative from
Florida.[298]
A few years later, Schieble married an ice-skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her
stepfather's last name, as Mona Simpson. In 1970, after divorcing her second husband, Schieble took
Mona to Los Angeles and raised her alone.[299]
When Simpson found that their father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was living in Sacramento, California,
Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali did not treat his children well[300] and
according to the San Francisco Chronicle, this was because of finding a Seattle Times article about
Jandali's abandonment of his students on a trip to Egypt in 1974.[301] Simpson went to Sacramento
alone and met Jandali, who worked in a small restaurant. They spoke for several hours, and he told
her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He said he and Schieble had given another
child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." He said he once
managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that "all of the successful technology people
used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big
tipper". At the request of Jobs, Simpson did not reveal to Jandali that his own story meant that he had
actually already met his son.[302]
After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that "it was amazing ... I had been to that restaurant a few
times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands." However, Jobs
still did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to
try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... I asked Mona not to tell him about me".[302] Jandali
later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and
asked, "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?". Simpson told him that it was true and later commented,
"My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ... He never contacted
Steve". Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet the family, she
assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Jobs also never
showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East. Simpson fictionalized the search for their
father in her 1992 novel The Lost Father.
[296] Malek Jandali is their cousin.[303]
Jobs's views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery.[304] He maintained privacy
even over what few of these actions were publicly known. He has been a key figure in public
discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful. Through his career, the media
investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among
powerful leaders and especially billionaires. His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all
large global philanthropy.[305] Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large
anonymous donations.[304]
Philanthropy
9/9/25, 11:24 PM Steve Jobs - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs 24/51
Jobs received the National Medal of
Technology from President Ronald
Reagan in 1985, awarded jointly with
Steve Wozniak.
Mark Vermilion, former charitable leader for Joan Baez, Apple, and Jobs, attributed Jobs's lifelong
minimization of direct charity to his perfectionism and limited time. Jobs, Vermilion, and supporters
said over the years that corporate products were Jobs's superior contributions to culture and society
instead of direct charity.[305]
In 1985, Jobs said, "You know, my main reaction to this money thing is
that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing
that's happened to me."[304]
Shortly after leaving Apple, he formed the charitable Steven P. Jobs Foundation, led by Mark
Vermilion, hired away from Apple's community leadership. Jobs wanted a focus on nutrition and
vegetarianism, but Vermilion wanted social entrepreneurship. That year, Jobs soon launched NeXT
and closed the foundation with no results. Upon his 1997 return to Apple, Jobs optimized the failing
company to the core, such as eliminating all philanthropic programs, never to be restored. In 2007,
Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among "America's least philanthropic
companies". A few months after another unflattering news report, Apple started a program to match
employees' charitable gifts.[305] Jobs declined to sign The Giving Pledge, launched in 2010 by Warren
Buffett and Bill Gates for fellow billionaires.[305][304] He donated $50 million to Stanford hospital and
contributed to efforts to cure AIDS. Bono reported "tens of millions of dollars" given by Apple while
Jobs was CEO, to AIDS and HIV relief programs in Africa, which inspired other companies to
join.[305]
1985: awarded National Medal of Technology (with Steve
Wozniak) by US President Ronald Reagan, the country's

Elon Musk
Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28,
1971) is an international businessman and entrepreneur
known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly
Twitter), and the Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE). Musk has been the wealthiest person in the
world since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his
net worth to be US$424.7 billion.
Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk
emigrated in 1989 to Canada; he had obtained Canadian
citizenship at birth through his Canadian-born mother.
He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United
States, before moving to California to pursue business
ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software
company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded
X.com, an online payment company that later merged to
form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That
year, Musk also became an American citizen.
In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company
SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the
company has since led innovations in reusable rockets
and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker
Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO
and product architect in 2008; it has since become a
leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded
OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research
but later left; growing discontent with the organization's
direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the
2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the
social network Twitter, implementing significant
changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other
businesses include the neurotechnology company
Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the
tunneling company the Boring Company, which he
founded in 2017.

Elon Musk on his departure from the
Department of Government Efficiency
Recorded May 30, 2025
Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S.
presidential election, and is a supporter of global farright figures, causes, and political parties. In early 2025,
he served as senior advisor to United States president
Donald Trump and as the de facto head of DOGE. After
a public feud with Trump, Musk left the Trump
administration and announced he was creating his own
political party, the America Party.
Musk's political activities, views, and statements have
made him a polarizing figure, especially following the
COVID-19 pandemic. He has been criticized for making
unscientific and misleading statements, including
COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy
theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and
transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was
controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate
speech and the spread of misinformation on the service.
His role in the second Trump administration attracted
public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in
Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[1][2] He
is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[3][4] His
mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian
born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South
Africa.[5][6][7] Musk therefore holds both South African
and Canadian citizenship from birth.[8] His father, Errol
Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer,
pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property
developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati
Private Nature Reserve.
[9][10][11][12]
His maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, who died in a plane crash when Elon was a toddler,
was an American-born Canadian chiropractor, aviator and political activist in the Technocracy
movement[13][14] who moved to South Africa in 1950.[15] Haldeman's anti-government, antidemocratic and conspiracist views, which included the promotion of far-right antisemitic conspiracy
theories,[16][17] "fanatical" support of apartheid,
[17] and according to Errol Musk, support of
Nazism,
[15] have been suggested as an influence on Elon.
[18][19][20][21] During his childhood, Elon was
told stories by his grandmother of Haldeman's travels and exploits, and Elon has suggested that all of
Haldeman's descendants have his "desire for adventure, exploration – doing crazy things".[22]

Early life
9/9/25, 11:28 PM Elon Musk - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk 2/75
Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High
School in South Africa.
Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, and four paternal halfsiblings.[23][24][7][25] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.
[26][27] The
Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[12] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that
Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[12]
in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made
was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".[28][29] Errol was elected to
the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that
his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.
[1]
After his parents divorced in 1979, Elon, aged around 9, chose to live with his father because Errol
Musk had an Encyclopædia Britannica and a computer.[30][3][9] Elon later regretted his decision and
became estranged from his father.[31] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he
described as a "paramilitary Lord of the Flies" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were
encouraged to fight over rations.[32]
In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was
thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[33]
Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[33] Errol denied
berating Elon and claimed, "The [other] boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him
stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"[34]
Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The
Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[11][35] At age ten,
he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the
VIC-20 user manual.[36] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office
Technology magazine for approximately $500.[37][38]
Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School,
Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School,
where he graduated.[39] Musk was a good but unexceptional
student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math
certification.[40] Musk applied for a Canadian passport
through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's
mandatory military service,
[41][42] which would have forced
him to participate in the apartheid regime,[1] as well as to ease
his path to immigration to the United States.[43] While waiting
for his application to be processed, he attended the University
of Pretoria for five months.[44]
Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[45][46] and
worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[47]
In 1990, he entered Queen's University in
Kingston, Ontario.
[48][49] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he
studied until 1995.[50] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of
Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science
in economics from the university's Wharton School.
[51][52][53][54][55] He reportedly hosted large,
ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic bookscanning service similar to Google Books.

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research
Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–
based startup Rocket Science Games.
[57][58]
In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in
materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[53][51][59] Musk decided to join the
Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a
response.[60][41] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and
work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[59]
In response, Musk said he was allowed
to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former
business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.[61]
In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web
software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's
father.[62][31] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo
Alto.[63] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide
for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and
yellow pages.[64]
According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was
coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[63] The Musk
brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the
Chicago Tribune,
[65] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with
CitySearch.
[66] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[67] Compaq acquired
Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[68][69] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-
percent share.[70]
In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[71] The
startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over
200,000 customers joined the service.[72] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced
and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[73] The following year, X.com
merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[63][73][74] Founded by Max Levchin and
Peter Thiel,
[75] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than
X.com's service.[76]
Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over
Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[77] Due to resulting technological issues
and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in
2000.[78][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in
2001.[80][81]
In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5  billion in stock, of which Musk—the

largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[82][83]
In 2017, Musk purchased
the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental
value.[84][85]
In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and
discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on
Mars.
[86] Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space,
Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russian companies
NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras. Musk instead decided to start a
company to build affordable rockets.[87] With $100 million of his early
fortune,[88] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the
company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[89][90]
SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[91]
Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a
Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from
NASA, then led by Mike Griffin.
[92][93] After two more failed attempts
that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt,[91] SpaceX succeeded in
launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[94] Later that year, SpaceX
received a $1.6  billion NASA contract for Falcon 9-launched Dragon
spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing
the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.
[95]
In 2012, the Dragon
vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[96]
Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a
Falcon 9 on a land platform.[97] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships,
an ocean-based recovery platform.[98]
In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural
mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.
[99][100] Since 2019,[101] SpaceX
has been developing Starship, a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.[102]
In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2,
becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with
the ISS.[103]
In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of
its lifespan.[104]
In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to
provide satellite Internet access.
[105] After the launch of prototype satellites in 2018, the first large
constellation was deployed in May 2019.[106] As of May  2025, over 7,600 Starlink satellites are
operational,[107] comprising 65% of all operational Earth satellites.[108] The total cost of the decadelong project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be
$10 billion.[109][b]

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk provided free
Starlink service to Ukraine, permitting Internet access and
communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of
$400  million.[112][113][114][115][116] However, Musk refused to
block Russian state media on Starlink.[117][118]
In 2023, Musk
denied Ukraine's request to activate Starlink over Crimea to
aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear
response.[119][120][121]
Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July
2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men
played active roles in the company's early development prior
to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of
investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35  million,
became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of
directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role
within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but
was not deeply involved in day-to-day business
operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in
2007, and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from
the firm.[126][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as
CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit
settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two
others.[129][130]
Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500
vehicles, it was the first mass production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[131] Under
Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan
Model S (2012), the crossover Model X (2015), the mass-market sedan Model 3 (2017), the crossover
Model Y (2020), and the pickup truck Cybertruck (2023).[132][133][134][135][136]
In May 2020 Musk resigned as chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the
SEC over him tweeting that funding had been "secured" for potentially taking Tesla private.[137][138]
The company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called
Gigafactories.
[139] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[140] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it
became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[141][142] and it entered the S&P 500 later that
year.[143][144]
In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in
U.S. history to do so.[145]

Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for
SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded
in 2006.[146] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest
provider of solar power systems in the United States.[147]
In
2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an
advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the
size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[148]
Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed
in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until
early 2020.[149][150]
Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it
with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's
announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was
facing liquidity issues.[151] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's
directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the
expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[152][153] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020,
leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[154][155] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's
favor.[151]
In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology
startup, with an investment of $100  million.[156][157]
Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial
intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the
brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the
devices to communicate with software.[157][158] The company
also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions
like spinal cord injuries.
[159]
In 2022, Neuralink announced
that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[160]
In
September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved
Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials.[161]
Neuralink has conducted animal testing on macaques at the University of California, Davis. In 2021,
the company released a video in which a macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink
implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to
claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that
Neuralink violated the Animal Welfare Act.
[162] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk
to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a
federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[163]

In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct
tunnels; he also revealed plans for specialized, underground,
high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per
hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in
major cities.[164][165] Early in 2017, the company began
discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction
of a 30-foot (9.1  m) wide, 50-foot (15  m) long, and 15-foot
(4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices,
as that required no permits.[166]
The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2  km) in
length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs
and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at
suboptimal speeds.[167] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles,
have been canceled.[168][169] A tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in
early 2021.[170]
 Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[171]
In early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter and had
questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of
speech.
[173][174][175] By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the
company,[176] making him the largest shareholder.
[177][c] Musk later
agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of
directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the
company.[179][180] Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy
Twitter.[177][181] By the end of April Musk had successfully
concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[182] This included
approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in equity
financing.
[183][184] Having backtracked on his initial decision,[185]
Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022.[186]
Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag
Agrawal;
[186][187] Musk became the CEO instead.[188] Under Elon Musk, Twitter instituted monthly
subscriptions for a "blue check",[189][190][191] and laid off a significant portion of the company's
staff.[192][193] Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after
his takeover.[194][195][196][197]
In late 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's
moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election.
[198]
Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll,[199][200] and five months later, Musk
stepped down as CEO and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer
(CTO).[201]
Despite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral
misinformation,
[202] hate speech, and antisemitism controversies.[203][204] Musk has been accused of
trying to silence some of his critics such as Twitch streamer Asmongold, who criticized him during one

of his streams.[205] Musk has been accused of removing their accounts' blue checkmarks, which
hinders visibility and is considered a form of shadow banning,
[206][207] or suspending their accounts
without justification.[208]
In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a
vactrain, and assigned engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to
design a transport system between Greater Los Angeles and
the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6
billion.[209][210] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept,
dubbed the Hyperloop,
[211]
intended to make travel cheaper
than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[212]
In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit
artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop
artificial general intelligence, intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[213] Musk pledged $1
billion of funding to the company,[214] but only donated $50 million.[215]
In 2018, Musk left the
OpenAI board.[216] Since 2018, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning.[217]
In
July 2023, Musk launched the artificial intelligence company xAI, which aims to develop a generative
AI program that competes with existing offerings like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Musk obtained funding
from investors in SpaceX and Tesla,[218]
 and xAI hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[219]
Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceXlinked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[221][222]
His heavy use of the jets and the consequent fossil fuel usage have
received criticism.[221][223] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social
media through ElonJet.
[224][225][226]
In December 2022, Musk
banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, and made temporary bans
on the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the
incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and
journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN,
and The Intercept.

Musk with then-president-elect Donald
Trump in November 2024
Musk is an outlier among business leaders who typically avoid
partisan political advocacy.[228][229][230] Musk was a
registered independent voter when he lived in California.[231]
Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and
Republicans,
[232] many of whom serve in states in which he
has a vested interest.[233] Since 2022, his political
contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his
first vote for a Republican going to Mayra Flores in the 2022
Texas's 34th congressional district special election.
[234][235]
In
2024, he started supporting international far-right political
parties, activists, and causes,[236] and has shared far-right
misinformation[237][238][239] and numerous conspiracy
theories.
[240][241] Since 2024, his views have been generally
described as right-wing.[242]
Musk supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012,
[243] Hillary
Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden in 2020,
[244] and Donald Trump in
2024.
[245]
In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential
primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and
expressed support for Yang's proposed universal basic income,
[246] and endorsed Kanye West's 2020
presidential campaign.
[247]
In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the Build Back Better Act,
a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to
unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats.[248]
In 2022, Musk said he would start supporting Republican Party candidates,[249] and gave over
$50  million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee.
[250]
In 2023, he
supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to his
campaign,[250] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces
event.[251][252][253] From June 2023 to January 2024, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with
Republican and Democratic candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
[254] Vivek Ramaswamy,
[255]
and Dean Phillips.
[256]
By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[257]
In July 2024,
minutes after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk endorsed him for president saying;
"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery."[258][259] During the presidential
campaign, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally,[260] and during the campaign promoted
conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud[261] and immigration, in support
of Trump.[262][263] Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election.[264]
In 2025, Musk
contributed $19 million to the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, hoping to influence the state's future
redistricting efforts and its regulations governing car manufacturers and dealers.[265][266]

Musk at a 2024 gathering with Trump and
other political leaders
Musk giving a gesture at the second
inauguration of Donald Trump before
saying "My heart goes out to you. It is
thanks to you that the future of civilization
is assured."
[271][272]
Musk's international political actions and comments have
come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, especially from
the governments and leaders of France, Germany, Norway,
Spain and the United Kingdom, particularly due to his
position in the U.S. government as well as ownership of
X.[267][268][269] An NBC News analysis found he had boosted
far-right political movements to cut immigration and curtail
regulation of business in at least 18 countries on six continents
since 2023.[270]
During his speech after the second inauguration of Donald
Trump, Musk twice made a gesture interpreted by many as a
Nazi or a fascist Roman salute.
[d] He thumped his right hand
over his heart, fingers spread wide, and then extended his
right arm out, emphatically, at an upward angle, palm down
and fingers together. He then repeated the gesture to the
crowd behind him. As he finished the gestures, he said to the
crowd, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the
future of civilization is assured."[271][272][274]
It was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute in
Germany,[275][276][277] where making such gestures is
illegal.
[278] The Anti-Defamation League said it was not a Nazi
salute,[279] but other Jewish organizations disagreed and
condemned the salute.[280][281][282][283] American public opinion was divided on partisan lines as to
whether it was a fascist salute.[284] Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them
as "dirty tricks" and a "tired" attack.[285][286] Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated it as
a Nazi salute.[287][279] Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from
entering their countries.[288][289]
The concept of DOGE emerged in a discussion between Musk and Donald Trump, and in August
2024, Trump committed to giving Musk an advisory role, with Musk accepting the offer.[290]
In
November and December 2024, Musk suggested that the organization could help to cut the U.S.
federal budget, consolidate the number of federal agencies,[291][292] and eliminate the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau,
[293][294]
 and that its final stage would be "deleting itself".[295]
In January 2025, the organization was created by executive order, and Musk was designated a "special
government employee".[296][297] Musk is leading the organization and is a senior advisor to the
president,
[298] although his official role is not clear.[299]
In sworn statement during a lawsuit, the
director of the White House Office of Administration stated that Musk "is not an employee of the U.S.
DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization", "is not the U.S. DOGE Service

administrator", and has "no actual or formal authority to make
government decisions himself".[300][301] Trump said two days later
that he had put Musk in charge of DOGE.[302] A federal judge has
ruled that Musk acts as the de facto leader of DOGE.[303]
Musk's role in the second
Trump administration,
particularly in response to
DOGE, has attracted public
backlash. He was criticized for
his treatment of federal
government
employees,[304][305][306]
including his influence over the
mass layoffs of the federal
workforce.
[307][308][309] He has
prioritized secrecy within the
organization[310] and has accused others of violating privacy laws.[296]
A Senate report alleged that Musk could avoid up to $2 billion in legal
liability as a result of DOGE's actions[311]
In May 2025, Bill Gates
accused Musk of "killing the world's poorest children" through his cuts
to USAID,
[312] which modeling by Boston University estimated had
resulted in 300,000 deaths by this time, most of them of children.[313][314]
Musk announced on May 28, 2025, that he would depart from the Trump administration as planned
when the special government employee's 130 day deadline expired,[315] with a White House official
confirming that Musk's offboarding from the Trump administration was already underway.[316] His
departure was officially confirmed during a joint Oval Office press conference with Trump on May 30,
2025.[317]
After leaving office, Musk criticized the Trump administration's Big
Beautiful Bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its
provisions increasing the deficit.[319] A feud began between Musk
and Trump, with its most notable event being Musk alleging Trump
had ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on X (formerly Twitter) on
June 5, 2025.[320][321] Trump responded on Truth Social stating
that Musk went "CRAZY" after the "EV Mandate" was purportedly
taken away and threatened to cut Musk's government
contracts.[322][323] Musk then called for a third Trump
impeachment.[324] The next day, Trump stated that he did not wish
to reconcile with Musk, and added that Musk would face "very
serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates.[325] On
June 11, Musk publicly apologized for the tweets against Trump,
saying they "went too far."[326]

[327]
Rejecting the conservative label,[328] Musk has described himself as
a political moderate, even as his views have become more right-wing
over time.[329] His views have been characterized as libertarian and
far-right,
[330][331] and after his involvement in European politics,
they have received criticism from world leaders such as Emmanuel
Macron and Olaf Scholz.
[332][333][334][335]
Within the context of American politics, Musk supported
Democratic candidates up until 2022, at which point he voted for a
Republican for the first time.[243][249][245] He has stated support for
universal basic income,
[336] gun rights,
[337]
freedom of speech,
[338]
a tax on carbon emissions,
[339] and H-1B visas.
[340] Musk has
expressed concern about issues such as artificial intelligence (AI)[341] and climate change,
[342] and has
been a critic of wealth tax,
[343]
short-selling,
[344] and government subsidies.
[345] An immigrant
himself, Musk has been accused of being anti-immigration, and regularly blames immigration policies
for illegal immigration.
[346] He is also a pronatalist who believes population decline is the biggest
threat to civilization,[347] and believes in the principles of Christianity.
[348][349] Musk has long been
an advocate for space colonization, especially the colonization of Mars. He has repeatedly pushed for
humanity colonizing Mars, in order to become an interplanetary species and lower the risks of human
extinction.
[350]
Musk has promoted conspiracy theories and made controversial statements that have led to
accusations of racism, sexism, antisemitism,
[351][352]
transphobia,
[353] disseminating disinformation,
and support of white pride.
[354][355] While describing himself as a "pro-Semite",[356] his comments
regarding George Soros and Jewish communities have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation
League and the White House.
[357] Musk was criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for making
unfounded epidemiological claims,[358] defied COVID-19 lockdowns restrictions,[359] and supported
the Canada convoy protest against vaccine mandates.
[360][361] He has amplified false claims of white
genocide in South Africa.[362]
Musk has been critical of Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza war,
[363] praised China's
economic and climate goals,[364][365] suggested that Taiwan and China should resolve cross-strait
relations,
[366][367] and was described as having a close relationship with the Chinese
government.
[364][365]
In Europe, Musk expressed support for Ukraine in 2022 during the Russian invasion, recommended
referendums and peace deals on the annexed Russia-occupied territories,
[368][369] and supported the
far-right Alternative for Germany in Germany in 2024.[370] Regarding British politics, Musk blamed
the 2024 UK riots on mass migration and open borders,
[371][372] criticized Prime Minister Keir
Starmer for what he described as a "two-tier" policing system,[373][374][372] and was subsequently

In 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) for a tweet stating that funding had been
secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[137][e] The
securities fraud lawsuit characterized the tweet as false,
misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly
traded companies.
[137][381][382] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or
denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was
forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[138]
Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[383] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla
not liable.[384] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered
the SEC investigation.[385][386]
In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half  a  million cars that year.[387] The SEC
reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement
agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement
details,[388]
including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[389]
In 2020, a judge
blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated
the agreement.[390][391] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC
concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "Tesla's solar
roof production volumes and its stock price".[392]
In October 2023, the SEC sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into
whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[393][394][395]
In February 2024,
Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[396]
In January 2025, the SEC filed a lawsuit
against Musk for securities violations related to his purchase of Twitter.[397]
In January 2024,
Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package
from Tesla be rescinded.[398] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board
"an unfathomable sum" that was unfair to shareholders.[399]
Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.[50] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in
California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[400] He then relocated to Cameron County,
Texas,
[401][402] saying that California had become "complacent" about its economic
success.[400][403][404]

While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome (now merged
with autism spectrum disorder).[405][406] When asked about his experience growing up with
Asperger's syndrome in a TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Musk stated that "the social cues were
not intuitive ... I would just tend to take things very literally ... but then that turned out to be wrong —
[people were not] simply saying exactly what they mean, there's all sorts of other things that are
meant, and [it] took me a while to figure that out."[407] Musk suffers from back pain and has
undergone several spine-related surgeries, including a disc replacement.[408][409]
In 2000, he
contracted a severe case of malaria while on vacation in South Africa.[410]
Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he doses "a
small amount once every other week or something like that";[411] since January 2024, some media
outlets have reported that he takes ketamine, marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, mushrooms, cocaine and other
drugs. Musk at first refused to comment on his alleged drug use, before responding that he had not
tested positive for drugs, and that if drugs somehow improved his productivity, "I would definitely
take them!".[412] The New York Times' investigations revealed Musk's overuse of ketamine and
numerous other drugs, as well as strained family relationships and concerns from close associates who
have become troubled by his public behavior as he became more involved in political activities and
government work.[413] According to The Washington Post, President Trump described Musk as "a bigtime drug addict".[414]
Through his own label Emo G Records, Musk released a rap track, "RIP Harambe", on SoundCloud in
March 2019.[415][416][417] The following year, he released an EDM track, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe",
featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[418]
Musk plays video games, which he stated has a "'restoring effect' that helps his 'mental
calibration'".[419] Some games he plays include Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.
[420][421]
Musk once claimed to be one of the world's top video game players but has since admitted to "account
boosting", or cheating by hiring outside services to achieve top player rankings.
[422][423][424] Musk
has justified the boosting by claiming that all top accounts do it so he has to as well to remain
competitive.[425][424][426]
In 2024 and 2025, Musk criticized the video game Assassin's Creed
Shadows and its creator Ubisoft for "woke" content.[427] Musk posted to X that "DEI kills art" and
specified the inclusion of the historical figure Yasuke in the Assassin's Creed game as offensive; he
also called the game "terrible". Ubisoft responded by saying that Musk's comments were "just feeding
hatred" and that they were focused on producing a game not pushing politics.[428][429]
Musk has fathered at least 14 children, one of whom died as an infant.[430] The Wall Street Journal
reported in 2025 that sources close to Musk suggest that the "true number of Musk's children is much
higher than publicly known".[431] He had six children with his first wife, Canadian author Justine
Wilson, who he met while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in
2000.[432]
In 2002, their first child Nevada Musk died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of
10 weeks.[433] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[434]
they had twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006.[434] The couple divorced in 2008 and have

shared custody of their children.[435][436] The elder twin he
had with Wilson came out as a trans woman and, in 2022,
officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,
[437]
adopting her mother's surname because she no longer wished
to be associated with Musk.[437]
Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley in 2008.[438]
They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in
Scotland.[439][440]
In 2012, the couple divorced, then
remarried the following year.[441] After briefly filing for
divorce in 2014,[441] Musk finalized a second divorce from
Riley in 2016.[442] Musk then dated the American actress
Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[443]
 he had reportedly been "pursuing" her since 2012.[444]
In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes confirmed they were dating.[445] Grimes and Musk
have three children, born in 2020, 2021, and 2022.[446][447][448][449] Musk and Grimes originally gave
their eldest child the name "X Æ A-12", which would have violated California regulations as it
contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet;[450][451]
the names registered on
the birth certificate are "X" as a first name, "Æ A-Xii" as a middle name, and "Musk" as a last
name.[452][453] They received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to
pronounce;[454] Musk has said the intended pronunciation is "X Ash A Twelve".[453] Their second
child was born via surrogacy.
[455] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple
were "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he
was single.[456][457]
In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X Æ AXii.[458][459][460] Elon Musk has taken X Æ A-Xii to multiple official events in Washington, D.C.
during Trump's second term in office.
[461]
Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole
Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following
year.[462] Musk denied the report.[463] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha
Bassett, who has been described as "an occasional girlfriend".[464]
In October 2024, The New York
Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and their mothers,[465]
though Musk
denied having done so.[466]
Musk also has four children with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink:
twins born via IVF in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in
2025.[467][468][469][470][471][472] Musk allegedly had a child with author Ashley St. Clair in
2024.[431][473]
On February 14, 2025, Ashley St. Clair, an influencer and author, posted on X claiming to have given
birth to Musk's son Romulus five months earlier, which media outlets reported as Musk's supposed
thirteenth child.[474][475] On February 22, 2025, it was reported that St Clair had filed for sole custody
of her five-month-old son and for Musk to be recognised as the child's father.[476][477] On March 31,
2025, Musk wrote that, while he was unsure if he was the father of St. Clair's child, he had paid St.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk 16/75
Clair $2.5 million and would continue paying her $500,000 per year.
[478][479][480][481][482] Later
reporting from the Wall Street Journal indicated that $1 million of these payments to St. Clair was
structured as a loan.[431]
Elon Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$371 billion as of
August 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,
[483] and $408  billion according to
Forbes,
[484]
 primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.
Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012,[485]
 around 75% of Musk's wealth was
derived from Tesla stock in November 2020.[486]
 Describing himself as "cash poor",[487][488]
 he
became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December
2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.[489]
 in early 2025, Musk's net
worth was briefly over $487 billion according to Forbes[490]
Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[491][492] whose stated purpose is to
provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas, with an interest in human space exploration,
pediatrics, renewable energy, and "safe artificial intelligence".[493] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation
donated nearly half of its $25 million directly to Musk's OpenAI.[494][495] The foundation's assets
reached $9.4 billion by the end of 2021, but it only dispensed $160 million to charities that year.[496]
The Musk Foundation has been criticized for its "self-serving"[496] donations to efforts close to Musk's
family and companies,[497] as well as its low payout ratio.[496][498]
In 2021, after Musk challenged
World Food Programme director David Beasley to draft a plan to use money of Musk's that Beasley
said could contribute to ending world hunger,
[499][500] Musk instead donated the $6 billion in
question to his own foundation even after Beasley's plan showed that the money could feed 42 million
people for a year.[501][496][502]
Although his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries starting in the
2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric
who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements,
contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk's actions and
his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure.[503] Biographer Ashlee Vance described
people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his "part philosopher, part troll" persona on
Twitter.[504]
Musk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse,
social media, industry, politics, and government policy.[505] After Trump's re-election, Musk's
influence and actions during the transition period and the second presidency of Donald Trump led

[508]
some to call him "President Musk", the "actual president-elect", "shadow president" or "copresident".[506][507]
Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets
include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low
Transportation Award in 2008,[509]
the Fédération Aéronautique
Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[510] and the Royal Aeronautical
Society Gold Medal in 2012.[511]
In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate
in engineering and technology from Yale University[512] and an Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.
[513] Musk was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[514][f]
In 2022, Musk
was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.
[516]
Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world in
2010,[517] 2013,[518] 2018,[519] and 2021.[520] Musk was selected as Time's
"Person of the Year" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal
wrote that, "Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals
have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off
Earth too."[521][522]
a. Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.
[79][80]
b. SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for
Starlink.[110][111]
c. He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of
US securities laws and the centerpiece of a current SEC investigation and lawsuit against him.[178]
d. The "Roman salute" is a gesture which was used by Italian Fascists, then adopted by the Nazis. It
is not believed to have been used by ancient Romans.[273]
e. Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged
reference to marijuana.
[378]
 Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that
Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[379][380]
f. In 2024, Musk's Royal Society membership was criticized by 74 members over his alleged antiscientific behavior and promotion of misinformation, prompting debates about the society's
standards on membership and leading to the resignation of Dorothy Bishop, a neuropsychologist
at the University of Oxford, who cited her dissatisfaction with the Society's response.[515]

51. Vance (2017), p. 368. Musk produced a document for me dated June 22, 2009, that came from
Judith Haccou, the director of graduate admissions in the office of the registrar at Stanford
University. It read, "As per special request from my colleagues in the School of Engineering, I have
searched Stanford's admission data base and acknowledge that you applied and were admitted to
the graduate program in Material Science Engineering in 1995. Since you did not enroll, Stanford
is not able to issue you an official certification document." Musk also had an explanation for the
weird timing on his degrees from Penn. "I had a History and an English credit that I agreed with
Penn that I would do at Stanford," he said. "The I put Stanford on deferment. Later, Penn's
requirements changed so that you don't need the English and History credit. So they awarded me
the degree in '97 when it was clear I was not going to go to grad school, and their requirement
was no longer there."

enough independent authority to require him to be confirmed by the Senate under the
Constitution's Appointments Clause. "The record of his activities to date establishes that his role
has been and will continue to be as the leader of DOGE, with the same duties and degree of
continuity as if he was formally in that position,'" wrote Chuang, an appointee of former President
Obama. Chuang rejected the Trump administration's argument that Musk is not the DOGE
administrator and is instead merely a senior adviser to the president who has no independent
authority."

Schuster, 2023, 670 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024),
pp. 6, 8, 10. "There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely
satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or
shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be
abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's
possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins
the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man." (p. 10.)
